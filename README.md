# responsive-ecommerce-website
This project showcases a responsive e-commerce website I meticulously designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Following a successful interview at my previous company, I was presented with the challenge of creating a responsive e-commerce platform. Over the course of three days, I dedicated myself to crafting this project. Though seemingly straightforward, it was a significant milestone for me as a fresher at the time.
